				This article introduces a Transformer-based Generative-model that is capable of generating high quality audio samples for music production by conditioning the transformer by a simple 2d coordinate within a condition/sample map. With the rise of language models,
				also for audio generation language is used for generating samples. However, we think that in this domain this is not working because a sample cannot be described by a natural language. It is more natural for the human to describe an abstract thing with words 
				as 'closer to this' or 'I want something more in this direction'. We therefore conditioned a transformer with a trained 2d embedding for querying audio samples more intuitively and efficient. Our results can be explored by a interactive web demo.
